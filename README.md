# clastic-music-app

JS files are minified with uglifyjs

```
uglifyjs patch.js -o patch.min.js
```

The repo is not deployed nor it is being served from Github. Files are actually copied to these two folders:

```
https://vigliensoni.com/clastic-music // has the minified production files
https://vigliensoni.com/clastic-dev  // has the non-minified development files
```
